# mastermind

This is a command line version of the classic game "Mastermind"

It has two modes:
1. You can play as the "code breaker", and the computer makes the code.
2. You can play as the "code master" and make the code for the computer.

The project was created for The Odin Project curriculum, and demonstrates:
- Understanding and use of classes and inheritance
- Understanding and use of methods
- Understanding and use of enumeration methods
